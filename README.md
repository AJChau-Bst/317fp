# Final Design Document


# Implementation Notes
The implementation process of Self Care Pet was incredibly rewarding, challenging, and showcased the complex nature of app development and implementation. To start, we’ll go over the key implementation decisions of Self Care Pet. We developed the app using javascript, and CSS using React. We got a large portion of our components from React Native, and React Native Paper. We choose components from React Native, and React Native Paper for both their aesthetics and functionality. One of the highlights from React Native Paper is the Card Component. It has the functionality we need to display a user's current Mood Message, but it also has plenty of room to grow. The Card has the ability to add an image and or an icon. In any future development of the app, the icon is where you would post an emoticon representing how you feel. We chose the bottom tab navigation from React Native, as it has the opportunity to expand with custom badge icons. Additionally, it reminds the user of the features the app has and is far more intuitive than the drawer navigation. We made sure to leave the Settings page up at the top corner to signify to the user that it was much different than the five options at the bottom of the page. The user’s focus will stay at the bottom of the page where all the main actions occur. The order of the bottom tabs are also deliberate. The main page that we open to is the “Your Pet” screen– and it’s the main focus of the app. We also want to incentivize the user to get some sort of social interaction so it’s directly followed up by the social page, along with the friends tab. We follow the social section with another life necessity Fitness. We moved the Status page to the end as it’s not a tab that will be used as often.

On the main pet page, we choose progress bars as it’s exciting to be able to visually see your progress as you complete tasks throughout the day. A key part of our implementation was incorporating that visual update with the progress bar in tandem with how the pet is doing. The heart of our app is the attachment and care you develop towards your pet. Seeing the pet feel better is another mood booster– and it is also associated with a textual description of how your pet is doing. We also wanted to implement a way to track the user’s fitness, and we did that through a map view that follows the user through the day.

While we did not get the opportunity to maximize the UI experience throughout the whole application, there are key moments where we worked hard to create meaningful interactions. The design of Self Care Pet’s main cat was created using Figma assets and we worked to create faces that could get across the pets feelings without completely demoralizing the user. On the social page, there were a series of modifications made to the Cards for user’s posts. The body text was relatively small, so we switched it to the Card title to emphasize the user’s current mood. We also gave them two lines to express themselves in, as 1 line was too little, and we also wanted to limit the length of the messages so users would not feel overwhelmed. In future iterations of the app, we hope to institute the character limit in the text input itself. The color of the Mood Message text was also important. To show the clear difference between your personal Mood Message and your friends we choose two separate colors. Additionally, friend messages are stored in a flat list while your own message is static at the top of the page.

We store a significant portion of our data in Firestore, and have a total of four collections: App Storage, FriendsLists, MoodMessages, and FriendRequests (which is not used in our final implementation, but will remain in our database for future uses). App Storage stores the user’s Pet Data/Self Care statistics. Documents are labeled by the user’s email. Each document stores three boolean values: checkedBreakfast, checkedLunch, and checkedDinner. They represent what meal boxes the user has ticked in the app. The other three fields are numbers representing the user’s other status bar progress, aptly labeled hygieneProgress, sleepProgress, and waterProgress. It is pulled from to display all the information on the Status page. The FriendsLists collection has documents also labeled by the user’s email. Each document contains the array friendArray. FriendArray stores strings of the emails  belonging to the user’s friends on the app. The MoodMessages collection once again is labeled by the user’s email. All the fields are stored as strings. CurrentMood is a string that is overwritten whenever you write in a new Mood Message. We don’t want to keep a backlog of messages, instead it acts as a status message to inform your friends how you’re feeling at the moment. Similarly timeStamp gets overwritten when you post so it gets an accurate time of posting. This is important because time of posting gives your friends another chance to understand where you’re coming from. A Mood Message posted at noon on a saturday feels very different than one that’s posted at 3am on a Thursday. The last field is email, and it was added for ease of retrieval during the process of displaying all of your friends emails on their Mood Messages. The last section of data stored in Firestore is our FriendRequests collection. This collection is defunct, but left as the requesting progress was an executable function but we ran into issues with users actually accepting the requests. While we would have loved to get this implementation finished, we switched gears to a simple add friend mechanic where you would simply add friends based on their email addresses. We also use Firebase to organize all our user data. It handles identifiers using the user’s email address. Using email to sign in, and to verify their account information.

Moving on to the topic of noteworthy aspects of our code. One of them is the modular nature of our SocialScreen and FriendsScreen. Separating these components simplified the development process and made the code much more readable to anyone viewing it. We also have a series of catch exceptions, so our code won’t completely break even if something malfunctions. We have also littered helpful console logs throughout the code to demonstrate what information is being passed through different components for ease of debugging. We have also implemented a bar chart using React Native Chart Kit. This is something new that we had not used before in class, so it was exciting to work with it in our final implementation.

There are a series of things that did not reach our expectations in terms of functionality, and the general way it works. Our login page caused us trouble when inputting an email and password. With each letter input, the keyboard pops down, and then pops back up. It is a bit of a nuisance and results in the user needing to wait a little longer to input their information. This is a pitfall as in the real world, it would be an instant uninstall for any user that downloaded the app. On the main pet page, whenever you click on and increment the self care stats it rerenders the page in a jarring way. The visual representation of the cat looks glitchy for a moment, and the bottom navigation also rerenders in a distracting way. It’s relatively disorienting and that is not something we would like for our self care app. There are also some issues with the status page and how the data is displayed. During our testing process the tracking across days has not worked effectively. There are a series of issues with the graphs, and the representation of the days is not consistent and is not remotely intuitive. On the social screen, you can only write so much before your message gets cut off, as we only allowed two lines for the message. There is no feedback to the user about this issue and that is not ideal.

Lastly we’ll present our prioritized wishlist of next implementations, to keep this list concise we will present the top three next implementations. Our biggest priority moving forward would be to reinstate the requestFriends function, and then work to get a functioning way of receiving the requests, and accepting the requests. We’ve put this as our top priority because as of now, anyone with an account and the email you used to sign up can see what you’ve posted. Once again, not ideal. The next implementation we would like to work on is feedback on the fitness page. As of right now the user has no way of understanding how far they’ve walked throughout the day. Additionally, there is no exercise bar on the main Your Pet page so we would link the progress from there and pass it to our Your Pet page. The last implementation we would prioritize is setting up “Food Spots.” The idea of a “Food Spot” is the user sets areas they visit where they can get food. Then they can only increment their food checks when they’ve been at a “Food Spot” for a set amount of time. Since we already have tracking services from our map, this is a great way to incorporate that data. It also gives the user another incentive to push them to be accurate in the data they submit. It would also be another great use of the mobile aspect of the app. To end, a bonus task would be to polish the UI and aesthetics of the app! Once the previous three implementations are fleshed out, and the UI polished, we feel like our app would be in a great place to place on an app platform.
